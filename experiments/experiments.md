#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was how to use my first type of sensor.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as, installing a light dimmer in a globe.

### SETTING THE TONE WITH A PIEZO BUZZER ###

(experiment 6)

#### Photo of completed project ####
In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.
